        <h1>Oven-Roasted Chicken Thighs</h1>
        <img src="https://example.com/images/chicken-thighs.jpg" alt="Oven-Roasted Chicken Thighs" width="600">
        <p>When we need a chicken dinner on the fly, oven-roasted chicken thighs are our go-to. They’re more flavorful than lean breasts, meatier than drumsticks, and less prone to overcooking. This recipe ensures crispy skin while keeping the meat juicy and tender.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (6 to 8 ounces each)</li>
            <li>1-1/4 teaspoons sea salt</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Mild olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust the oven racks to the middle and lowest positions and heat the oven to 450°F (232°C). Place a rimmed baking sheet on the lower oven rack.</li>
            <li>Pat the chicken dry with paper towels. Trim all visible fat from the thighs. Using the tip of a paring knife or a metal skewer, poke the skin side of the chicken thighs 10 to 12 times. Lightly rub the chicken thighs on all sides with a little olive oil and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken thighs, skin side down, on the preheated baking sheet. Return the sheet to the lower rack. Roast the chicken thighs until the skin begins to brown and the meat registers 160°F (71°C), 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the sheet once halfway through cooking. Remove the chicken from the oven and heat the broiler.</li>
            <li>While the broiler heats, flip the chicken skin side up. Broil the chicken on the upper rack until the skin is crisp and well browned and the meat registers 175°F (79°C), 3 to 5 minutes, rotating the sheet as needed for even browning.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a platter or individual plates and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
